The bad news is my tragic failure to grasp @font-face. Despite the rumors that Safari, Opera, and the latest Firefox release support it, it does absolutely nothing when I try to apply it to that little welcome page. I'm currently trying to use the font <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/1-junction">Junction</a> from The League of Moveable Type, but I've tried several others, in case the font file I downloaded was the problem. Seemingly, it wasn't. Currently, Firebug doesn't even show my @font-face declaration, which leaves me a little concerned about my syntax.

I'm using some pretty simple code, nothing remotely fancy:

<code>/* Font credit: http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/1-junction */
@font-face {
    font-family: Junction;
    src: url(font-info/Junction-01.otf) format("opentype");
    font-style: normal;
}</code>

I've been reading bits and pieces on @font-face for months and been excited to have a place to try it out. Slushmine's dull Tahoma seemed like a great candidate, but if I bang my head against the desk much longer I may just settle for that.</div></body></html>
