The documentation on their site is pretty minimal, so I've come up with a lot of what may be very dumb questions that I've been forced to answer myself, by trial and error (how tacky).

I figured I would post these in hopes of saving someone else some wondering:

<strong>1. Can you treat an array like an array once it's part of your template data?</strong>

Yep. In my data, Columns is an array, and this code works great:

<code>&lt;table class="{#if $T.Columns.length == 1}onecolumn{#/if}"&gt;
							{#if $T.Columns[0].Label != null}
								&lt;thead&gt;
								...
</code>

<strong>2. Does whitespace matter?</strong>

Apparently not - see above.

<strong>3. How do you refer to a property of a parent object from a child template?</strong>

I couldn't figure this out, so I worked around it by adding the property I needed to the root object I was passing into the child. I ended up doing this in a function because neither of the two delimiters jTemplates uses - {} and {#} - can be used for straight assignment as far as I could tell.

<code>{#foreach $T.Columns as c_f}
											{#include COLUMN_CELL root=addFieldType($T.c_f,$T.FieldType)}
										{#/for}
										...
		function addFieldType(obj, ft) {
			obj.FieldType = ft;
			return obj;
		}
</code>

<strong>4. Can I put a property of the current object into my call to a child template?</strong>

Seems like no. What I really wanted to do instead of the code above was this, which does not work:

<code>{#foreach $T.Columns as c_f}
											{#include COLUMN_CELL[$T.FieldType] root=$T.c_f}
										{#/for}
										...
		{#template COLUMN_CELL[0]}
										&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="radio" disabled="disabled"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		{#/template COLUMN_CELL[0]}
		{#template COLUMN_CELL[1]}
										&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		{#/template COLUMN_CELL[1]}
</code>


For now, all I have is those four items.. I'm sure I'll come up with more as I get into the hard parts.</div></body></html>
