If you're not a Rails dev and are also unfamiliar, it's pretty much what it sounds like: developers volunteer to take a shift answering the phone if anyone calls, and other developers can call in and ask their Rails questions of a real person, absent the distractions of IRC or typing in general. Though I rely on IRC pretty heavily when I run into questions, this made immediate sense to me, because sometimes I run into things I just don't have the words for, or I need a longer, more abstract explanation than is comfortable to type into a chat window.</p>
<p>So, long story short, I set up a <a href="http://javascript.pockethotline.com/">JavaScript Hotline</a>. You can hit my hip <em>right now</em> (for some definitions of right now) at (877) 300-2187. But I'm not the only JS dev I know, so I'm hoping that before long, it won't be just me. If you want to volunteer to answer some questions, there's a button right there on the site that'll sign you up. Pocket Hotline, the company that provides this service, has a cute <a href="http://javascript.pockethotline.com/volunteer">intro video about volunteering</a> if you think you might be interested. If you've never done any teaching or mentoring, this seems to me like a really awesome way to get started. You'd be amazed how much you learn answering other people's questions, and obviously it's a great way to meet other devs in the community.</p>
<p>If you don't want to contribute time, there's also a button on that main page to contribute money. ;) The service is free for the first two hours, but it'll take money to continue it after that.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, if you need the sort of JavaScript help that <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</a> and IRC alone sometimes can't provide, now you have someone you can (literally) call.</p></div></body></html>
