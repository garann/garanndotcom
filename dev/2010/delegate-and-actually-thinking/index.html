Inspiration has been hard to come by, which is why this blog has been a little quiet. The project I'm on at work is chaos and most of the time I feel like a code monkey. No new technologies, no interesting experiments, nothing fun to think about. But there's been a high point.</p> 
<p>jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/delegate/"><code>delegate</code></a> has been my personal <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4HQyqc-aVU">plate of shrimp</a> lately. Another developer I know in town mentioned she was having some problems with it - prior to that I'd never even heard of it and had been quite content to go along using <code>live</code> for everything. As a result I started talking about it with my neighbor at work, and then he linked me to some blog posts comparing it to <code>live</code>. Then it came up in a few other places. Now it's all over our Javascript at work. Crazy!</p>
<p>During this period, there has been a lot of figuring things out and I have come to like <code>delegate</code> quite a bit. I like it because - unlike many things in jQuery - it's not all super-accepting and magical. You actually have to <i>think</i> about how you're using it. And thinking about it is not some ascetic endeavor, like coding in Perl or something. There's a real benefit to thinking it through and using <code>delegate</code> instead of <code>live</code> or <code>bind</code>. Sometimes using a library like jQuery makes me feel I'm not really in control of my code and I miss the old days when we did it all by hand. Using <code>delegate</code>, by comparison, actually feels like the tools are helping me improve the quality of my code without sacrificing my ability to make choices about how it does things.</p>
<p>Sometimes really trivial stuff makes me enormously happy. I'm a dork.</p>
<p>One of the coolest things is that I've gained is an understanding of <code>live</code>, which I've relied on heavily but had never given much thought to. Now that I know how it and <code>delegate</code> work, both seem at once brilliant and obvious. Why listen to a gazillion little anchor tags when you can listen to their container and wait for them to bubble up? I wish I'd heard about this method ten years ago. I don't know, maybe events didn't bubble the same way then. It's been educational also in terms of learning which events do and do not bubble. There are a lot of things I'd like to go back and refactor, armed with this knowledge.</p>
<p>I've "flipped through" <a href="http://jqfundamentals.com/book/book.html">jQuery Fundamentals</a>, but this has left me feeling I should devote a weekend to reading the whole thing. There's so much I miss just looking at API documentation for things I'm already using. It's really nice to discover something rad I'd overlooked, and to actually have to think about it.</p></div></body></html>
