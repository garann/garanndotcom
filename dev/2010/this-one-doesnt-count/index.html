Until the end of the year, we're competing to see who can write more posts on our personal blogs (more <em>quality</em> posts, not nonsense and rants). I'm hoping that this will be incentive for me to write more posts that include the &lt;code&gt; tag as a way of promoting something useful, instead of just for sarcastic effect. But even if it doesn't, I think it's a cool thing for a boss to encourage and am looking forward to the deluge of wisdoms from my closest peers.</p>

<p>Because these dudes are interesting and intelligent, and have been called upon to write more content, I thought I'd share the links I'll be following closely for the next five months:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://craveytrain.com/blog/">Craveytrain</a> - Our newest UI Engineer and the only other person in our Austin office who knows three ways to clear a float.</li>
	<li><a href="http://cbsides.com/blog">CB Sides</a> - Our counterpart in NYC and resident expert on cool things we don't often get to play with, like Drupal and phoneGap.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rubikzube.com/blog/">rubikzube</a> - Our boss, who besides being a cool guy is responsible for me now having these links.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm obligated by the official rules to mention my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/garann">LinkedIn profile</a> so that if you're interested in working with these cool folks you will know to whom to send your resum√©. Ranting and nonsense will resume shortly, cause I don't want to look like I'm trying too hard.</p></div></body></html>
