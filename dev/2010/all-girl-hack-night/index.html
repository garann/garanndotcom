If you're in Austin reading this and you're a woman or know a woman who does development of any kind, you should check it out/pass it on!</p>
<p>Austin has a lot of great tech meetups - Refresh and Austin JS are two I try to go to every month - but seemingly no groups for technical women. And the things is, I know they're out there and for some reason not coming to the aforementioned events. At the Texas Javascript pre-party at Gingerman, I ran into a woman on the patio who was a frontend dev. I asked her if she was going to the conference. She said no.</p>
<p>I don't know that a women-only meetup would be any more compelling to women who don't normally come to these things. But I figure it's worth a shot. (Literally. If you get a woman to sign up for the group I'll totally owe you a shot.)</p></div></body></html>
