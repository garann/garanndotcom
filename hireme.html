				<p>Hi, my name is Garann Means. I'm an <a href="#experience">experienced full-stack JavaScript developer</a> and I'd like to tell you the things I can do for your organization.</p>
				<aside id="experience">Experience matters a great deal to me because I feel it teaches pragmatism. I've seen tools and techniques come and go, and it's taught me to value creating products of use to those they're meant to benefit above all else.</aside>
				
				<p class="emoji">ðŸŽ¬ I can write your front-end JS</p>
				<p>Front-end JavaScript is my bread and butter, and I can write nearly anything you need. I've been writing simple DOM manipulation scripts since the nineties. At <a href="#editorially">Editorially</a> I worked on a very complex JS front-end that worked heavily with the text selection API. At <a href="#glg">Gerson Lehrman Group</a> I built a single-page app for creating custom surveys with complicated input fields such as matrices, weighted questions, and conditional branching all available for the user to create via front-end interactions.</p>

				<p class="emoji">ðŸ”¨ I can structure your HTML and CSS ðŸŽ¨</p>
				<p>Thoughtful HTML and CSS are necessary not only for a nice design, but for performance and accessibility. I'm proud to have added the first CSS for layout to the <a href="#sos">WA Secretary of State</a> site, ushering it out of the table-based layout era. At <a href="#vast">Vast</a> I worked on cleaning up deeply nested HTML so JavaScript could access elements more easily. At <a href="#uship">uShip</a> I worked on a way to provide the equivalent to <code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code> before it was supported using only HTML and CSS.</p>

				<p class="emoji">ðŸ‘¾ I can work on your back-end</p>
				<p>The coding pieces of my <a href="#evergreen">Computer Science</a> education used back-end languages. I wrote a .NET MVC framework for <a href="#starling">Starling Systems</a> before the platform included one, wrote a widget library in Java for <a href="#eoscene">Eoscene</a>, and even wrote some COBOL to maintain legacy code at the <a href="#doc">WA State Department of Corrections</a>. Even in front-end roles, I wrote a bit of PHP at <a href="#etsy">Etsy</a> and some Ruby at <a href="#editorially">Editorially</a>. I've written or maintained Node services at several companies, and use it as the back-end for most of my side projects.</p>

				<p class="emoji">ðŸ”­ I can help you plan your technical strategy</p>
				<p>I've received formal trainings in project management techniques twice, and even studied UML in school, but I've found that the less recent those become, the more I end up helping plan technical strategy. At <a href="#etsy">Etsy</a> I participated in modularizing existing JavaScript and at <a href="#editorially">Editorially</a> I helped restructure JS as a Backbone application. Since 2008, there's almost no work I've done that hasn't required assessing tools and frameworks. I'd explained the different advantages of various JS template engines so many time that I wrote a small tool capturing my research to help others choose the one that fit their needs.</p>

				<p class="emoji">ðŸŽ“ I can train your developers up</p>
				<p>When I started the Austin chapter of <a href="#gdi">Girl Develop It</a>, I didn't have any other instructors lined up, so I taught everything. I've given trainings in HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, JS architecture, and Node. I've also organized trainings led by others, finding qualified instructors and teaching materials as well as dealing with administrative elements like venues and fees. As a conference speaker, I've given introductions to Node, CSS3, and to JS templates on numerous occasions.</p>

				<p class="emoji">ðŸ“š I can write about your product</p>
				<p>As someone who's learned many technologies on my own, good documentation is something I appreciate hugely. Besides blogging, I've contributed to docs on Mozilla Developer Network and I've written about using Node as a web server in a book from O'Reilly and a set of articles for A List Apart.</p>
